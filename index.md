## **PRO**cess engineering with **I**nconsistency **MA**nagement

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-EPL--2.0-ce03fc.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/EPL-2.0)

PROxIMA is a process modeling and simulation framework. It enables the optimization of the modeled processes for semantic inconsistencies.

The features of the framework include:
 -  A visual process modeler based on the FTG+PM formalism that enables the modeling processes along with a formalism transformation graph as its strong type system.
 -  A fully modeled process enactment module.
 -  A process simulation and optimization module, with the ability to rewrite the process.
 -  The catalogue of inconsistency patterns and the catalogue of management patterns is fully extensible.


We are gradually migrating the source code. The first public release (0.2.0) is tentatively scheduled for Q1/2021.
